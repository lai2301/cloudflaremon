# API Keys Configuration Example
# 
# IMPORTANT: Never commit actual secrets to your repository!
# This file shows the format only.
#
# Set API_KEYS secret using one of these methods:
# 1. Wrangler CLI: npx wrangler secret put API_KEYS
# 2. GitHub Secrets: Add in repo Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
# 3. Cloudflare Dashboard: Workers → Your Worker → Settings → Variables
#
# See docs/SECURITY.md for detailed instructions

# API_KEYS should be a JSON string mapping service IDs to their API keys
# Format: {"service-id": "api-key", ...}
# Generate keys with: openssl rand -base64 32

# Example JSON format (set this as the API_KEYS secret value):
{
  "service-1": "your-secret-key-here-1",
  "service-2": "your-secret-key-here-2",
  "my-api": "your-secret-key-here-3"
}

# One-line version for command line (escape quotes):
# {"service-1":"key1","service-2":"key2"}
